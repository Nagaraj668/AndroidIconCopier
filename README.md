# AndroidIconCopier

Hello Android Developers,

In our busy App development, We cannot spend more time on simple things. 

For example,

If We use material design icons provided by google(https://design.google.com/icons), It tool will be really useful.

We need to copy every image from drawable folders, and paste it to appropriate mipmap-xxxxx folders. Here after no need for this.

I hope below picture speaks a lot than I explain and will be helpful.
